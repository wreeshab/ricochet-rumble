<h1>RICOCHET RUMBLE</h1>

<h2>Normal Mode</h2>

1)Create an 8x8 grid for the game board. Make the base config as shown in the video
2)Make the cannon shoot a circular bullet. Implement movement logic and move validation for each piece: they can move to adjacent or diagonally adjacent cells or rotate.
3)Add a time system: Each player gets specific amount of time. The timer must decrement during the respective playerâ€™s turn. If the timer balls down to 0, the other player wins.
4)Make the game mobile responsive.
5)Add pause, resume and reset feature.
